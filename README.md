# CSS and Bootstrap: Responsive Portfolio


This is a responsive portfolio built using Twitter Bootstrap. 

We were give comps in which I tried to follow in good faith as an exercise in meeting client requests, learning the Bootstrap grid, and creating multi-page sites. I did, however, put my on twist on style.

Ultimately, I hope to rewrite this website completely. Along the way, I've learned that powerful imagery can make a difference. Bootstrap also makes for a great foundation on which you can apply your own style.

I look forward to learning more in my journey of being a front-end developer and continuing to play with the front-end.
