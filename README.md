# CSS and Bootstrap: Responsive Portfolio


This is a responsive portfolio built using Twitter Bootstrap. 

We were given comps that I followed in large degree as an exercise in:

* Meeting client requests.
* Mastering the Bootstrap grid.
* Creating multi-page sites. 
* Keeping my code as clean and simple as possible by coding in a mobile-first approach. I strived to keep Bootstrap classes to a minimum, specifying specific breakpoints (-sm, -lg, etc.) only where necessary.

In fact, you can view how I coded for the original styling by uncommenting the CSS file `"default-hw.css"` or you can check out the file on GitHub here.

There are other things that I considered, including use of columns on desktop, making sure to test on multiple breakpoints, using an HTML validator, using semantic HTML, and using Git for source control.

I did put my own twist on style, by playing with the CSS. 

Ultimately, I hope to rewrite this website completely and play around with the front-end. Along the way, I've learned that Bootstrap makes for a great foundation on which you can apply your own style. I've also learned that powerful imagery can make a difference. 

I look forward to continuing to play with the front-end and with front-end development.
